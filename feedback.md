Feedback from Docker Innovation Day, Barcelona, Nov. 2015

- Find a way to chat with more ppl in one channel, how to separate conversations in a multi ppl conversation
- Can you integrate conversations with other channels
- Displaying images and charts of monitoring data in the channel
- How to address problems of specific applications?
  - If you have dozens of applications you're most likely interested in only one of them
  - Giving them an alias which you can easily integrate in conversation
- Who to be contacted when Ruxit detects a certain service is broken
  - Check back at github who pushed changes to the service

- Portability: Is the bot useable with other tools than ruxit?
